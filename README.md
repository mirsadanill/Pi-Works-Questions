Q4,Q5,Q6 ile ilgili sorular country_vaccination_stats.csv dosyası kullanılarak çözüldü
Q4=Code Implementation Task: Implement code to fill the missing data (impute) in daily_vaccinations column per country with the minimum daily vaccination number of relevant countries.  
Note: If a country does not have any valid vaccination number yet, fill it with “0” (zero). 
Please  provide the link to your code as answer to this question

Q5=Code Implementation Task: Implement code to list the top-3 countries with highest median daily vaccination numbers by considering missing values imputed version of dataset.
Please  provide the link to your code as answer to this question

Q6=What is the number of total vaccinations done on 1/6/2021 (MM/DD/YYYY) by considering missing values imputed version of dataset? Please  just provide the number as answer.

Q8=Assume any database includes below columns and you are requested to process Stats_Access_Link column and extract pure url information inside per device type. 
Xml tags and protocol parts is guaranteed to be lower case  
Access link part that we are interested in can have alpha-numeric, case insensitive characters, underscore ( _ ) character and dot ( . ) character only.  
What would you use for this task, please write your detailed answer with exact solution? Please  provide the link to your code as answer to this question 
Example: for the device type AXO145, we would like to get xcd32112.smart_meter.com regardless from its access protocol is SSL secured or not.

Q12 için dataset.csv dosyası kullanıldı.
Q12=There 4 dimensional (4 feature) numerical inputs (signatures) with labels!
We need a simple model that takes these inputs and labels them (Virus, Not a Virus)
We also need you to evaluate your model. Choose any metric you want, but don't forget to explain why, since I don't know much about this field (that is why we need your help!)
Things to keep in mind:

There are less 'Virus' in the dataset than 'Not a Virus'. (Naturally!)
While we call it MAGIC, it still sometimes doesn't work well 🤦‍, so there are signatures with missing features (missing values).
I don't know much about these things so please show your work, your thinking process and please make it as clear as possible, otherwise I get confused 😵. (Visualizations of the data and comments in your code would be great!)
